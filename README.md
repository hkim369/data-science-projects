# Data Science Portfolio

** This Repository contains the portfolio of my data science projects presented in the form of iPython Notebooks. **


* [Analysis and Prediction for Stock Price](http://https://github.com/hkim369/stock-price/blob/main/Stock_analysis.ipynb)
Analysis and prediction for close prices of stocks: Look at daily changes for close prices, and investigate correlations between stocks. Prediction models will be derived using time-series models.
 
* [Analysis for COVID impacts on Online Learning](https://github.com/hkim369/Online-Learning/blob/main/trends-of-online-learning.ipynb)
During the pandemic, most schools are closed. Some schools have been open, but adapted online learning even on campus to reduce contacts among students and between students and teachers. It is obvious that online learning engagement would be increased in 2020. But even before the school closed, many students had already used online learning. Probably online learning among students has increased as more students have their own devices and wireless connectivity has been improved. Luckily, they were very close to being ready to convert from in-person learning to online learning due to technology development. Then how much impact has pandemic caused on online learning?

* [Analysis of Kaggle survey](https://github.com/hkim369/Kaggle-Survery/blob/main/age-gender-education-and-experience-5.ipynb)
Kaggle users have created great notebooks including gorgeous visualization and thorough analysis. Who are the people publishing these nice notebooks? This will show their ages, genders, education levels, titles and experience from 2021 Kaggle survey.
