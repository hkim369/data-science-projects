# Data Science Portfolio

**This Repository contains data science projects completed by myself, which are presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.**


* Project 1: [Are high housing costs in San Francisco a result of population growth?](https://github.com/hkim369/SF-house-price)

Before COVID hit, the population in San Francisco was on the rise. A lot of houses are jammed together to accomodate many people in the city. Despite the high demand for housing, the cost of living in the city was extremely high. It is not surprising to say that the influx of people contributed to the rising housing prices. In this project, we aim to establish a connection between population growth and housing costs by analyzing publicly available data from the city, the US Census, and a real estate company called Zillow.

* Project 2: [Who are they?](https://github.com/hkim369/Kaggle-Survery/blob/main/age-gender-education-and-experience-5.ipynb)

Kaggle users have created great notebooks including gorgeous visualization and thorough analysis. Who are the people publishing these nice notebooks? This will show their ages, genders, education levels, titles and experience from 2021 Kaggle survey.

* Project 3: [COVID impacts on Online Learning](https://github.com/hkim369/Online-Learning/blob/main/trends-of-online-learning-2.ipynb)

During the pandemic, most schools are closed. Some schools have been open, but adapted online learning even on campus to reduce contacts among students and between students and teachers. It is obvious that online learning engagement would be increased in 2020. But even before the school closed, many students had already used online learning. Probably online learning among students has increased as more students have their own devices and wireless connectivity has been improved. Luckily, they were very close to being ready to convert from in-person learning to online learning due to technology development. Then how much impact has pandemic caused on online learning?

* Project 4: [Stock Price Prediction](https://github.com/hkim369/stock-price/blob/main/Stock_analysis.ipynb)

Look at daily changes for close prices, and investigate correlations between stocks. Prediction models will be derived using time-series models.

* Tableau project 1: [AirBnb Recommendation](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hayang.kim/viz/airbnb_dashboard_16674942278400/Airbnbdashboard)

This dashboard is for providing critical information to people who want to start AirBnb bussiness in New York City. 

* Tableau project 2: [Alcohol Consumption](https://github.com/hkim369/DataViz/tree/main)

Data visualization of alcohol consumption per capita for top 25 countries using Tableau.
